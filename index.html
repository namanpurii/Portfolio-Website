    <!--    The problem can be solved through inline display elements. <span> is an inline display element, unlike <div> which is a block display element.
            <span> element, like <divs> dont do much without CSS    -->
    <!--
        Common Inline Elements : 
        Spans(<span>)
        Images(<img>)
        Anchors(<a>)
        
        By default buttons(<button>) are inline-block
    -->
    <!-- So why dont we use <span> instead of <p> cuz clearly we can see they are more flexible. This is because. We cant change
    the width of <span> tag through CSS. While we can do for <p>(i.e., block element). But even after we decrease the width
    a block display element, it still wont let any other element to sit against/besides it. But we have the
    flexibility to change the property of an element from block to inline by changing the 'display' parameter -->
    <!--but again once you change block to inline you loose the ability to change its width. and if a block element cant be 
    changed, you have the ability to change its width but you cant let any other element to sit next to it. 
    Instead we can set, display : inline-block; which gives us the best of both worlds.-->

    <!-- Design 101
    Keep in mind heirarchy, layout, alignment, white spacing and audience while designing UI -->

    <!-- CSS Positioning : Default rules on how things get rendered on the screen
    1. Content is everything: Content is the first thing which determines how large things get displayed. Eg: h1 will occupy more height as compared to a <p> tag
    2. Order comes from HTML code: Order of elements comes from the HTML code. Changing the order will change the positioning.
    3. Children Sit on Parents: Refers to nesting tags. 
        Eg:
        <div>
            <p>A <span class="pro">pro</span>grammer</p>
        </div>
        Here <p> sits on <div> and <span> sits on <p> -->
    
    <!-- Position Property:
    1. Static : By default 
    2. Relative : Relative to previous position of the element, has 4 coordinates top, bottom, left and right. top: 100px; would move the object down by 100 px relative to its top edge.
    3. Absolute : Positioning element relative to its parent. 
    4. Fixed: To fix position of element while scrolling -->

    <!--Display Property:
    1. Block
    2. Inline
    3. Inline-Block
    4. None
    
    4. display: None; takes the element out of the flow of the document as if it never existed. It is useful when in a quiz you want
    things to appear after a certain action, or you can do, visibility: hidden; which hides the element keeping it in-flow i.e. keeping
    its position intact but it is not visible.
    -->
    <!--Look at Lecture 49 to discover 2 ways to center elements using CSS
    1. Using
        body{
            text-align:center;
        }
        This aligns the inline and block elements in the center of the webpage iff the width of any of the elements is not set
        i.e. not augmented or not changed/specified
    2. If the width of a <p> tag is changed to lets say 10% i.e. width: 10%;
        Then text-align wont center this element
        To solve this issue
        we use margin:auto; property to center the element
        Eg:
        p{
            width:10%;
            margin-left:auto;
            margin-right:auto;
        }
    -->
    <!--FONT STYLING in CSS
        Font Families: Serif(with feet) and Sans-Serif(without feet)
        CSS font properties:
        "font-family" command majorly has 6 properties, serif(default), sans-serif, monospace, cursive, fantasy, inherit out of which first 3 are useful
        monospace: has equally spaced characters, have high readability
        Default Serif Font=  Times Font
        Default Sans-Serif Font = Arial
